# Project Context: Student Loan Audit App

## Mission
Develop an iOS application that empowers U.S. student loan borrowers to audit their loan documents for potential errors and generate actionable reports or letters to address identified issues.

## Target Audience
- U.S. student loan borrowers seeking to identify and rectify errors in their loan documents.
- Individuals affected by misapplied payments, incorrect interest calculations, or other discrepancies.

## Key Features
- **PDF Parsing**: Extract relevant data from uploaded loan documents.
- **Audit Engine**: Analyze extracted data against predefined rules to identify potential issues.
- **Report Generation**: Provide users with clear summaries of identified issues and suggested actions.
- **Letter Templates**: Generate customizable letters for users to send to loan servicers or regulatory bodies.

## Design Principles
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the app is usable by individuals with disabilities, adhering to best practices for accessible design.
- **Privacy-First**: All data processing occurs locally on the user's device; no data is transmitted to external servers.
- **User-Centric**: Design with a focus on clarity, ease of use, and providing actionable insights.

## Technical Stack
- **Platform**: iOS
- **Language**: Swift
- **Frameworks**: SwiftUI for UI, PDFKit for PDF processing

## Claude Code's Role
- Assist in generating modular Swift code components based on provided prompts.
- Ensure generated code adheres to best practices for accessibility, privacy, and maintainability.
- Log all development actions in a scientific and structured journal format.
- Reference ongoing SIF research available at: https://github.com/MS-707/Darker-Edge/tree/main/journal_entries

## Repository Structure
- `/ios_app/`: SwiftUI views and related UI components.
- `/core_logic/`: Core functionalities including PDF parsing and audit engine.
- `/claude_prompts/`: Markdown files containing prompts for Claude Code.
- `/dev_notes/`: Documentation and notes for developers.
- `/tests/`: Unit and integration tests.
- `/tools/`: Auxiliary tools and scripts.
- `/docs/dev_diary/`: Research-aligned log files documenting AI-human co-development.

## Development Workflow
1. Define specific tasks and create corresponding prompts in `/claude_prompts/`.
2. Use Claude Code to generate code based on prompts.
3. Review and integrate generated code into the project.
4. Test functionalities and iterate as needed.
5. Document every step of the development process in the developer diary.

## Licensing and Distribution
- **License**: MIT License
- **Distribution**: Available on the App Store; open-source code hosted on GitHub.

# Claude Code Prompt: Create Project Repository Structure

## Purpose
Establish the foundational directory and file structure for the Student Loan Audit App, ensuring a modular and organized codebase.

## Inputs
- Project Name: `LoanAuditApp`
- Description: "An iOS application that audits student loan documents for potential errors and assists users in addressing identified issues."

## Output
- Directory structure:
  - `/ios_app/`
  - `/core_logic/`
  - `/claude_prompts/`
  - `/dev_notes/`
  - `/tests/`
  - `/tools/`
  - `/docs/dev_diary/`
- Files:
  - `README.md` with project overview.
  - `.gitignore` tailored for Swift projects.
  - `LICENSE` file with MIT License.

## Guidelines
- Ensure directories are created with placeholder `.gitkeep` files if necessary to maintain structure.
- `README.md` should include sections: Project Overview, Features, Installation, Usage, Contributing, License.
- `.gitignore` should exclude build artifacts, user-specific files, and other unnecessary files.
- Maintain consistency with Swift project conventions.
- Also create the following Markdown documentation files in `/docs/dev_diary/` using the formats below:

### 1. `dev_log.md` (Development Journal)
```
## [Date: YYYY-MM-DD | Time: HH:MM]
### Task:
[Short description of what Claude Code generated or modified.]

### Human Input:
[Prompt and context provided by the human.]

### Claude's Approach:
[Description of method, reasoning, or patterns used to fulfill the task.]

### Output Summary:
[List of files or components generated, and their purpose.]

### Time Estimate:
[Estimated time saved by automating this task or time taken to complete it.]

### Observations:
[Any challenges encountered, design decisions made, or notable outcomes.]
```

### 2. `techniques_used.md` (Code & Pattern Tracking)
```
## [Feature/Module Name]
- Design Pattern(s):
- Libraries/Frameworks Used:
- Accessibility Enhancements:
- Unit Testing Strategy:
- Architectural Considerations:
```

### 3. `sif_notes.md` (SIF Collaboration Insights)
```
## [Interaction ID or Task Name]
### Prompt-Shaping Evolution:
[How the human refined or clarified instructions to improve Claudeâ€™s performance.]

### Claude-Human Synergy:
[What each party contributed, how handoffs occurred, and any noteworthy dynamics.]

### Reflection:
[Did this task demonstrate an ideal SIF moment? Were there inefficiencies? What was learned?]

### Reference:
See related journal entries at: https://github.com/MS-707/Darker-Edge/tree/main/journal_entries
```

These templates are to be updated automatically or upon Claude's completion of relevant tasks. Document every meaningful interaction, coding technique, and insight to maintain a full research log of the project.
