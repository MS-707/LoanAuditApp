### Task:
Set up initial repository structure for the Student Loan Audit App.

### Human Input:
Create project repository structure based on the specified requirements in the project context document.

### Claude's Approach:
Followed the guidelines to create directory structure, essential files including README.md, LICENSE, and .gitignore, and implemented proper Git setup with main branch.

### Output Summary:
- Created directory structure: `/ios_app/`, `/core_logic/`, `/claude_prompts/`, `/dev_notes/`, `/tests/`, `/tools/`, `/docs/dev_diary/`
- Generated README.md with project overview, features, installation, and usage instructions
- Added Swift-specific .gitignore
- Included MIT License
- Set up Git repository with main branch
- Created development diary templates

### Time Estimate:
Approximately 15 minutes saved by automating the repository setup.

### Observations:
The repository structure follows modular organization principles, separating UI components from core logic and maintaining clear documentation guidelines. The dev_diary structure will help document the AI-human co-development process throughout the project lifecycle.

### Task:
Implement Loan Audit Rules Engine core functionality.

### Human Input:
Create the core audit logic used to analyze parsed student loan data and flag potential issues according to predefined rules.

### Claude's Approach:
1. Designed a protocol-based architecture for modular and extensible audit rules
2. Created data models for loan details, payments, and non-payment periods
3. Implemented four specific audit rules to detect common student loan issues
4. Built a flexible engine to run rules individually or as a complete audit

### Output Summary:
- Created `LoanDetails.swift` with data models for student loans, including payment history tracking
- Implemented `LoanAuditEngine.swift` with the following components:
  - `AuditRule` protocol defining the interface for all rules
  - Enums for `AuditSeverity` and `AuditIssue` types
  - `AuditResult` struct to standardize rule evaluation outcomes
  - Four rule implementations: `ExcessiveForbearanceRule`, `UnexplainedCapitalizationRule`, `ExtendedNonPaymentRule`, and `HighInterestRateRule`
  - Main `LoanAuditEngine` class to coordinate rule execution

### Time Estimate:
Approximately 45 minutes saved by implementing a comprehensive, modular audit engine.

### Observations:
The protocol-based design allows for easy addition of new rules without modifying the core engine. Each rule is responsible for its own logic while maintaining a consistent interface. The severity system provides useful context for users about which issues require immediate attention.
