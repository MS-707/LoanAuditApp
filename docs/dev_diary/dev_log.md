### Task:
Set up initial repository structure for the Student Loan Audit App.

### Human Input:
Create project repository structure based on the specified requirements in the project context document.

### Claude's Approach:
Followed the guidelines to create directory structure, essential files including README.md, LICENSE, and .gitignore, and implemented proper Git setup with main branch.

### Output Summary:
- Created directory structure: `/ios_app/`, `/core_logic/`, `/claude_prompts/`, `/dev_notes/`, `/tests/`, `/tools/`, `/docs/dev_diary/`
- Generated README.md with project overview, features, installation, and usage instructions
- Added Swift-specific .gitignore
- Included MIT License
- Set up Git repository with main branch
- Created development diary templates

### Time Estimate:
Approximately 15 minutes saved by automating the repository setup.

### Observations:
The repository structure follows modular organization principles, separating UI components from core logic and maintaining clear documentation guidelines. The dev_diary structure will help document the AI-human co-development process throughout the project lifecycle.
