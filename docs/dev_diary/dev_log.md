### Task:
Set up initial repository structure for the Student Loan Audit App.

### Human Input:
Create project repository structure based on the specified requirements in the project context document.

### Claude's Approach:
Followed the guidelines to create directory structure, essential files including README.md, LICENSE, and .gitignore, and implemented proper Git setup with main branch.

### Output Summary:
- Created directory structure: `/ios_app/`, `/core_logic/`, `/claude_prompts/`, `/dev_notes/`, `/tests/`, `/tools/`, `/docs/dev_diary/`
- Generated README.md with project overview, features, installation, and usage instructions
- Added Swift-specific .gitignore
- Included MIT License
- Set up Git repository with main branch
- Created development diary templates

### Time Estimate:
Approximately 15 minutes saved by automating the repository setup.

### Observations:
The repository structure follows modular organization principles, separating UI components from core logic and maintaining clear documentation guidelines. The dev_diary structure will help document the AI-human co-development process throughout the project lifecycle.

### Task:
Implement Loan Audit Rules Engine core functionality.

### Human Input:
Create the core audit logic used to analyze parsed student loan data and flag potential issues according to predefined rules.

### Claude's Approach:
1. Designed a protocol-based architecture for modular and extensible audit rules
2. Created data models for loan details, payments, and non-payment periods
3. Implemented four specific audit rules to detect common student loan issues
4. Built a flexible engine to run rules individually or as a complete audit

### Output Summary:
- Created `LoanDetails.swift` with data models for student loans, including payment history tracking
- Implemented `LoanAuditEngine.swift` with the following components:
  - `AuditRule` protocol defining the interface for all rules
  - Enums for `AuditSeverity` and `AuditIssue` types
  - `AuditResult` struct to standardize rule evaluation outcomes
  - Four rule implementations: `ExcessiveForbearanceRule`, `UnexplainedCapitalizationRule`, `ExtendedNonPaymentRule`, and `HighInterestRateRule`
  - Main `LoanAuditEngine` class to coordinate rule execution

### Time Estimate:
Approximately 45 minutes saved by implementing a comprehensive, modular audit engine.

### Observations:
The protocol-based design allows for easy addition of new rules without modifying the core engine. Each rule is responsible for its own logic while maintaining a consistent interface. The severity system provides useful context for users about which issues require immediate attention.

### Task:
Optimize `LoanAuditEngine.swift` based on multi-agent code review feedback.

### Human Input:
Implement a set of modular improvements based on GPT-4o review feedback, including syntax corrections, access-level clarity, better testability, internationalization, and code reuse.

### Claude's Approach:
1. Conducted comprehensive refactoring to address all feedback points
2. Extracted magic numbers into a centralized `AuditPolicy` struct for better maintainability
3. Created shared formatters for consistent string representation
4. Implemented a base class to consolidate duplicate logic between similar rules
5. Added unit testing support with test data factories
6. Added concurrency support via Swift async/await

### Output Summary:
- Added centralized configuration with `AuditPolicy` struct
- Created `AuditFormatters` for consistent date and number formatting
- Implemented `SeverityScaler` to standardize severity determination
- Added internationalization with `NSLocalizedString` wrappers
- Fixed incorrect `flatMap` usage in forbearance rule
- Made `AuditSeverity` conform to `CustomStringConvertible` and `Comparable`
- Made `AuditResult` conform to `Equatable` for testing
- Created `NonPaymentDurationRule` base class to reduce code duplication
- Added `ruleCode` property to all rules for better tracking and telemetry
- Added factory methods for testing with `LoanDetails.fakeForbearance()`, etc.
- Implemented `performAuditAsync()` using Swift Concurrency

### Time Estimate:
Approximately 90 minutes saved by implementing comprehensive improvements that would have required multiple iterations.

### Observations:
The multi-agent review process identified issues that might have been overlooked by a single developer. Refactoring for testability will enable more robust unit testing and help maintain the codebase as it grows. The consolidated architecture makes the code more maintainable while preserving its original functionality.
