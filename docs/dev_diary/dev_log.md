### Task:
Implement Loan Audit Rules Engine core functionality.

### Human Input:
Create the core audit logic used to analyze parsed student loan data and flag potential issues according to predefined rules.

### Claude's Approach:
1. Designed a protocol-based architecture for modular and extensible audit rules
2. Created data models for loan details, payments, and non-payment periods
3. Implemented four specific audit rules to detect common student loan issues
4. Built a flexible engine to run rules individually or as a complete audit

### Output Summary:
- Created `LoanDetails.swift` with data models for student loans, including payment history tracking
- Implemented `LoanAuditEngine.swift` with the following components:
  - `AuditRule` protocol defining the interface for all rules
  - Enums for `AuditSeverity` and `AuditIssue` types
  - `AuditResult` struct to standardize rule evaluation outcomes
  - Four rule implementations: `ExcessiveForbearanceRule`, `UnexplainedCapitalizationRule`, `ExtendedNonPaymentRule`, and `HighInterestRateRule`
  - Main `LoanAuditEngine` class to coordinate rule execution

### Time Estimate:
Approximately 45 minutes saved by implementing a comprehensive, modular audit engine.

### Observations:
The protocol-based design allows for easy addition of new rules without modifying the core engine. Each rule is responsible for its own logic while maintaining a consistent interface. The severity system provides useful context for users about which issues require immediate attention.

### Task:
Optimize `LoanAuditEngine.swift` based on multi-agent code review feedback.

### Human Input:
Implement a set of modular improvements based on GPT-4o review feedback, including syntax corrections, access-level clarity, better testability, internationalization, and code reuse.

### Claude's Approach:
1. Conducted comprehensive refactoring to address all feedback points
2. Extracted magic numbers into a centralized `AuditPolicy` struct for better maintainability
3. Created shared formatters for consistent string representation
4. Implemented a base class to consolidate duplicate logic between similar rules
5. Added unit testing support with test data factories
6. Added concurrency support via Swift async/await

### Output Summary:
- Added centralized configuration with `AuditPolicy` struct
- Created `AuditFormatters` for consistent date and number formatting
- Implemented `SeverityScaler` to standardize severity determination
- Added internationalization with `NSLocalizedString` wrappers
- Fixed incorrect `flatMap` usage in forbearance rule
- Made `AuditSeverity` conform to `CustomStringConvertible` and `Comparable`
- Made `AuditResult` conform to `Equatable` for testing
- Created `NonPaymentDurationRule` base class to reduce code duplication
- Added `ruleCode` property to all rules for better tracking and telemetry
- Added factory methods for testing with `LoanDetails.fakeForbearance()`, etc.
- Implemented `performAuditAsync()` using Swift Concurrency

### Time Estimate:
Approximately 90 minutes saved by implementing comprehensive improvements that would have required multiple iterations.

### Observations:
The multi-agent review process identified issues that might have been overlooked by a single developer. Refactoring for testability will enable more robust unit testing and help maintain the codebase as it grows. The consolidated architecture makes the code more maintainable while preserving its original functionality.

### Task:
Implement PDFLoanParser for extracting loan data from PDF documents.

### Human Input:
Develop a Swift module that uses PDFKit to parse student loan documents and populate the LoanDetails model.

### Claude's Approach:
1. Created a structured parser with error handling and validation logic
2. Implemented a multi-stage extraction strategy for different data fields:
   - Direct pattern matching for explicit fields (servicer name, loan ID)
   - Context-aware extraction for financial values (interest rate, current balance)
   - Section-based parsing for complex data (payment history, forbearance periods)
3. Developed robust date handling with multiple format recognition
4. Added extensive heuristics to handle variations across different loan servicers

### Output Summary:
- Implemented `PDFLoanParser.swift` with the following components:
  - Core parsing method: `extractLoanDetails(from:) throws -> LoanDetails`
  - Helper structures: `PDFParsingError`, `LoanServicerType`, `DateParsingUtils`, `NumberParsingUtils`
  - Document normalization for consistent text processing
  - Field-specific extraction methods for each LoanDetails property
  - Duplicate detection and validation logic
  - Fallback mechanisms and estimation for missing data

### Time Estimate:
Approximately 120 minutes saved implementing a comprehensive PDF parser that handles different document formats and edge cases.

### Observations:
The parser balances precision with robustness by using multiple extraction strategies for each field. By normalizing document text, using regex for pattern matching, and implementing strong validation, the parser can handle variations in document structure across different loan servicers while maintaining data quality. The modular design allows for easy extension with additional servicer-specific patterns in the future.

### Task:
Implement standardized LoanDetails model that aligns with both PDFLoanParser and LoanAuditEngine.

### Human Input:
Provide a single Swift file that defines the LoanDetails model shared by PDFLoanParser and LoanAuditEngine.

### Claude's Approach:
Refactored the model based on the standardized requirements, consolidating previous models into a structured, well-documented unit.

### Output Summary:
- Updated `LoanDetails.swift` with a more standardized structure:
  - Codable, Equatable, and Sendable conformance for serialization and threading safety
  - Clear nested type definitions for NonPaymentPeriod and PaymentRecord
  - Computed helper methods for analysis of payment patterns
  - Debug-only example method for simple test data generation

### Time Estimate:
Approximately 30 minutes saved by implementing a standardized model that properly interfaces with both the parser and audit engine.

### Observations:
Standardizing the data model creates a cleaner contract between system components and simplifies testing. The consistent structure makes it easier to extend functionality in the future.

### Task:
Implement AuditResultView for displaying audit findings in the UI.

### Human Input:
Create a SwiftUI view for displaying AuditResult objects from the LoanAuditEngine.

### Claude's Approach:
1. Designed a hierarchical view structure with list sections grouped by issue type
2. Created a color mapping system for different severity levels
3. Implemented expandable disclosure groups for suggested actions
4. Added comprehensive accessibility support

### Output Summary:
- Implemented `AuditResultView.swift` with:
  - Main list view with section-based organization by issue type
  - Row component for individual audit results with severity indicators
  - Color extension for AuditSeverity levels
  - Expandable disclosure groups for suggested actions
  - Empty state view with positive messaging
  - Mock data extension for previews and testing

### Time Estimate:
Approximately 45 minutes saved by implementing a complete UI component with preview and testing support.

### Observations:
- The hierarchical organization helps users understand related issues at a glance
- Color-coding creates immediate visual feedback about severity
- The critical severity level uses an additional visual treatment (outer ring) for emphasis
- Empty state provides positive feedback rather than just stating "no results"
